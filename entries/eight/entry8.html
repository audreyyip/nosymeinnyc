                        Three guys in their twenties, wearing regular clothing the day after Halloween. They look like they're about to head to some event.<br>

                        DUDE 2 has dirty-blond hair and is wearing a wife-beater and a leather jacket.<br>
                        DUDE 3 has curly hair and is also wearing a leather jacket or a varsity jacket.<br>
                        They sit on small and tall circular tables facing each other.
