                        I fucking complimented her in seminar at the beginning of the year. I complimented her by the second or third week like "oh, you always do the readings and stuff, that's so cool!" and she said "Thanks, my mom says I always talk my ass off." like huhh that's such a weird response.

                        Remember her project in Sustainable Systems? She presented it in class, and when our teacher asked her why she didn't wear it, she just said she didn't want t,o but I swear it's cuz she didn't even fucking sew it; that thing is pinned together! I bet she made that in high school! Also, when she asked if we could use old work?? Nonono, that's NOT how art school works if you're gonna take an old piece, you BETTER rework it.
