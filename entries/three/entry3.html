                            A girl with short brown wavy hair, she's put some effort into curling and styling it well, and she's wearing a loose white t-shirt with a nice dress with a 2000s office siren/librarian style rectangular framed glasses. She's working on some fashion project with her friends.<br>
                            EVAN is one of the tall guys with long blonde hair, wearing a black t-shirt, with his hair up in a bun.<br>
                            OTHER GUY is another tall guy with long blonde hair, though his hair is wavy and unkept (frizzy), and he's wearing purple t-shirt, with his hair down.<br>
                            GUY ON PHONE is on a phone call, driving somewhere.
