SETING: Washington Square Park. A bench on the outskirts of the fountain. There are still a lot of people chattering and hanging out at the park, all enjoying the cold breeze with the newly arrived autumn air.
<br>
PEOPLE: A group of students, presumably NYU students, who are very passionate about film. They are all dressed very fashionably. Multiple conversations are happening at once, but the conversation slowly melds into one.
<br><br>
GUY 1 is a white guy with brown hair, in a wolf cut, holding a beer and wearing a brown coat with fur lining. He sounds very opinionated and slightly pretentious. He is arguing mainly with two people, GIRL 1 and GUY 2.
<br>
GIRL 2 is a girl with red hair <br>
<br>
GUY 2 is a Black guy with an afro and wearing military print baggy shorts with a massive silver chain. He is wearing a green ribbed shirt with black side panels, and talking with a valley girl accent.
