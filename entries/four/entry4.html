                        At the wooden benches right outside of The New School University Center, the steps are full, and people are conversing all around us, with many students walking past the benches.<br><br>

                        GIRL 1 is listening to her friend, and she has short burgundy wavy hair with a magenta ribbon and silver clips in her hair, wearing a black baby doll dress.<br>
                        GIRL 2 is telling her friend about her date. She has blonde wavy hair and black rimmed glasses. She is wearing a white pinstripe shirt, light blue jean shorts that have the pockets sticking out, and black velvet sneakers with pink soles.

                        Honestly, I think drinking makes it worse. Maybe he's one of those people who, when they drink, it makes it worse.
