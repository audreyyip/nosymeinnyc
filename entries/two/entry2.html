                        Two men and two women at the bar, they all look as if they just got out of work.<br>
                        MAN 1 is wearing a white dress shirt with slicked back hair.<br>
                        MAN 2 is wearing a black suit, with a buzz cut.<br>
                        WOMAN 1 has long hair down, wearing a mini skirt.<br>
                        WOMAN 2 has her hair up in a ponytail, wearing a mini skirt.<br>
                        All four of them talking and laughing loudly, occasionally making jokes with the bartender.
